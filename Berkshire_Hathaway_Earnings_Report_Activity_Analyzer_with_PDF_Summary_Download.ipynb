        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- Automatically downloads PDF reports for three time periods:\n",
        "  1. Current quarter\n",
        "  2. Previous quarter\n",
        "  3. Same quarter from the previous year\n",
        "- Extracts text from PDF reports using advanced PDF parsing techniques\n",
        "- Analyzes the text to identify key investment activities, including:\n",
        "  - Acquisitions\n",
        "  - Purchases\n",

        "  - Other significant financial activities\n",
        "- Generates a comparative analysis across the three time periods\n",
        "- Creates a downloadable PDF summary with a structured table of activities\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "1. The user inputs the current quarter number and year\n",
        "2. The script generates URLs for the relevant Berkshire Hathaway quarterly reports\n",
        "3. PDFs are downloaded from Berkshire Hathaway's website\n",
        "4. Text is extracted from the PDFs using PyPDF2\n",
        "5. The extracted text is analyzed using regular expressions to identify various investment activities\n",
        "6. A comparison table is created, showing activities for each time period\n",
        "7. A summary PDF is generated using ReportLab, featuring the comparison table\n",
        "8. The summary PDF is automatically downloaded\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "1. Run the notebook cells in order\n",
        "2. When prompted, enter the number of the current quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4) and the last two digits of the current year\n",
        "3. The script will process the reports and generate a summary PDF\n",
        "4. The summary PDF will be automatically downloaded to your local machine\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications in Fintech\n",
